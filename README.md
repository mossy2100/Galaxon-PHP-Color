## Description

This package provides a comprehensive Color class for working with colors in PHP. The class is designed to be:

- **Immutable** - Color values cannot be changed after creation, ensuring predictability and thread safety
- **Memory-efficient** - Colors are stored internally as a 4-byte binary string
- **Feature-rich** - Supports RGB, HSL, hex strings, CSS color names, and accessibility calculations
- **CSS-compatible** - Outputs to modern CSS color formats (hex, rgb, hsl)

## Development and Quality Assurance / AI Disclosure

[Claude Chat](https://claude.ai) and [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) were used in the development of this package. The core classes were designed, coded, and commented primarily by the author, with Claude providing substantial assistance with code review, suggesting improvements, debugging, and generating tests and documentation. All code was thoroughly reviewed by the author, and validated using industry-standard tools including [PHP_Codesniffer](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer/), [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) (to level 9), and [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/index.html) to ensure full compliance with [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standards and comprehensive unit testing with 100% code coverage. This collaborative approach resulted in a high-quality, thoroughly-tested, and well-documented package delivered in significantly less time than traditional development methods.

## Requirements

- PHP ^8.4
- ext-ctype
- galaxon/core

## Installation

```bash
composer require galaxon/color
```

## Quick Start

```php
use Galaxon\Color\Color;

// Create colors from various formats
$red = new Color('red');
$orange = new Color('#ff8000');
$purple = Color::fromRgba(128, 0, 255);
$green = Color::fromHsla(120, 1.0, 0.5);

// Access color properties
$color = new Color('#ff8040');
$color->red;         // 255
$color->hue;         // 20.0
$color->lightness;   // 0.625

// Modify colors (returns new instance)
$darkRed = $red->withLightness(0.3);
$transparent = $red->withAlpha(128);

// Color operations
$mixed = $red->mix($blue, 0.5);
$complement = $red->complement();

// Accessibility
$textColor = $background->bestTextColor();  // 'black' or 'white'
$ratio = $color1->contrastRatio($color2);

// Output formats
echo $color->toHex();        // '#ff8040ff'
echo $color->toRgbString();  // 'rgb(255 128 64 / 1)'
echo $color->toHslString();  // 'hsl(20deg 100% 62.5% / 1)'
```

- Immutable modification methods (withRed, withHue, etc.)
- Color mixing and complementary colors
- WCAG accessibility calculations (contrast ratio, text color selection)
- Multiple output formats (hex, rgb(), hsl())

## Testing

The library includes comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
